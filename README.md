This is my submission for the MCG Health coding exercise which I was asked to complete.  The solution is written in JavaScript on the Node.JS platform using Jest for unit testing.

Before running or testing, be sure to install dependencies:

`npm install`

To test:

`npm test`

To execute as a usable console application:

`npm start`
